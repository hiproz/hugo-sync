3. deploy your hook server in your wordpress server and hugo server if necessary.
4. write in your wordpress page or in the github.the github will send webservice hook event to our hook server.  
5. the hugo hook server will update the hugo content and start the hugo procedural after received the github hook event msg . 6. after the finish of hugo converting, the static html page will be in public folder of hugo.  
7. the hugo hook server deploy the html to our website .
